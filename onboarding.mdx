### Step 1: Import your data from Chrome

Bring your bookmarks, history, and settings over from Chrome.

1. Navigate to `chrome://settings/importData`
2. Click **Import**
3. Follow the prompts and choose **Always allow** when asked to import everything at once

<Tip>
  This imports your bookmarks, history, passwords, and settings in one go.

### Step 2: Configure your AI models

Oryx works out of the box with default AI, but you can customize it completely.

1. Navigate to `New Tab` or `chrome://settings/browseros`
2. Click **AI Settings** to configure your preferred providers
3. Choose between cloud models (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini) or run locally with Ollama
